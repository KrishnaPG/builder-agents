**Very Brief Next Steps**

1. **Freeze v2.0 as Constitutional Spec**
   Version, hash, and mark immutable sections formally 

2. **Implement Constitutional Enforcement Layer First**
   Build compliance engine, hash-chain logging, autonomy ceiling enforcement

3. **Build Core Execution Backbone**

   * COA orchestration engine
   * Micro-task isolation containers
   * TDD pipeline with governance validation

4. **Ship Observable Control Surface**

   * Neural Graph (live DAG)
   * Autonomy dial
   * Escalation signaling

5. **Add Time + Logging Fabric**

   * Append-only event log
   * Time scrubber with replay

6. **Integrate Directive System**

   * Directive precedence engine
   * Mode bundles
   * Autonomy enforcement hooks

7. **Harden Governance & Resource Controls**

   * Security gates
   * Budget caps
   * Deadlock detection

8. **Release v1 with Minimum Requirements Only**
   Everything else remains sandboxed until deterministic stability is proven.
